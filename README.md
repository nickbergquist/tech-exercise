## Notes

- Viewport breakpoint at 480px - if the window is reduced in width the markup reverts to the default. There could perhaps be an accordion structure below 480px for mobile-sized widths

- As there were no designs in the brief there is limited styling and no typographical work in place. Having said that there is a basic SASS project built in readiness

- A progressive enhancement build has been undertaken so that the underlying HTML content is still accessible without Javascript

- The task is far from finished but represents what was achieved in just a few hours according to the brief
